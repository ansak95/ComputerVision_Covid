# üöÄ Project Overview
This repository presents an R&D project that harnesses an open-source dataset of chest X-ray images, a collaborative effort by researchers from Qatar University, Doha, Qatar, and the University of Dhaka, Bangladesh, with contributions from Pakistan and Malaysia, and the invaluable insights of medical professionals. This unique dataset includes validated chest X-ray images of COVID-19 positive cases, alongside Normal and Viral Pneumonia images.

## üìä Dataset
The dataset features a collection of around 11000 chest X-ray images, meticulously labeled as (disease:NORMAL/Viral Pneumonia/COVID)-(image path), providing a comprehensive resource for advanced medical image analysis.

## üí° Project Aim
The primary objective of this project is to develop a robust machine learning model for the classification of these X-ray images, distinguishing between normal, bacterial, viral, and COVID-19 related anomalies. This initiative seeks to compare the effectiveness of standard convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with advanced pre-trained models like ResNet50 and Xception, offering valuable insights into their performance in medical imaging tasks.

## üß† Machine Learning Models

- **Standard CNNs**: Implementing and evaluating baseline convolutional neural networks to establish foundational performance metrics.
- **Pre-trained Models**: Leveraging the power of advanced models such as ResNet50 and Xception, known for their high accuracy in image classification tasks, to analyze the chest X-ray images.

## üîç Analysis and Interpretation
The goal is not only to achieve high accuracy in image classification but also to understand the underlying patterns recognized by these models, providing crucial insights into the radiological aspects of different respiratory conditions, including COVID-19.

## ü§ù Open-Source Contribution
As an open-source project, contributions from the global community are highly valued. Whether it's improving the model, enhancing data analysis, or suggesting new features, input from diverse perspectives is crucial for the success and evolution of this project.
